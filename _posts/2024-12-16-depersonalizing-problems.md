title: Depersonalizing Problems: A Simple Way to Stay Calm Under Pressure
tags: empowerment self-growth 
---

In business, frustrations often feel personal, but they don’t have to. By focusing on the issue (not individuals), we can calm tensions and find better solutions.

🧩 Imagine the problem as a large balloon—it’s the _it_ we need to solve, not _you_ or _me_. 🗣️ Replace divisive language:

* You/Me → Use _We_ instead.
* Keep the conversation about the issue, not the person.

This small mindset shift can make problem-solving more collaborative and less confrontational.
