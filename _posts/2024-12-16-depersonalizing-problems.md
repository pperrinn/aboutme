In business, frustrations often feel personal, but they don’t have to. By focusing on the issue (not individuals), we can calm tensions and find better solutions.

🧩 Imagine the problem as a large balloon—it’s the “it” we need to solve, not “you” or “me.” 🗣️ Replace divisive language:

* “You/Me” → Use “We” instead.
* Keep the conversation about the issue, not the person.

This small mindset shift can make problem-solving more collaborative and less confrontational.
