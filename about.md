> Kaizen (改善) is a japanese term meaning "_continuous improvement_". It refers to the philosophy of making small, incremental changes every day to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness. Meanwhile, Ikigai (生き甲斐) is a Japanese concept meaning "_reason for being_". It represents the intersection of what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for, leading to a fulfilling and purposeful life.

## My journey

My journey in software development began during my time at (Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM))[https://www.upm.es/] where I earned a BSc in (Data Science & AI)[https://www.fi.upm.es/?id=gcdia#:~:text=Caracter%C3%ADsticas%20destacadas%20El%20grado%20en%20Ciencia%20de%20Datos,la%20Ingenier%C3%ADa%20y%20de%20las%20T%C3%A9cnicas%20de%20Negocio.]. Currently, I'm doing an internship as a cybersecurity specialist at (Roche Diagnostics)[https://www.roche.es/sobre-roche/roche-en-espana/roche-diagnostics], where I can apply these concepts and continue learning both software and high-level skills.

## What I Do

I am currently focused on:

* **Cybersecurity Risk Governance and Reporting**: Learning about Business Risk Managament Frameworks (BRMFs) using the latest technologies.
* **Software Engineering Projects**: (_coming soon_) Developing scalable, maintainable, and efficient software systems and infrastructures applied to stock markets predictions, automating processes, among others.
* **Personal Growth**: Continuously learning, improving, and seeking out new challenges to grow both professionally and personally.
