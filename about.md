> Kaizen (改善) is a japanese term meaning "_continuous improvement_". It refers to the philosophy of making small, incremental changes every day to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness. Meanwhile, Ikigai (生き甲斐) is a Japanese concept meaning "_reason for being_". It represents the intersection of what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for, leading to a fulfilling and purposeful life.

## My journey

My journey in software development began during my time at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) where I earned a BSc in Data Science & AI, but it’s my dedication to the philosophies of Kaizen and Ikigai that truly shape my professional and personal path. Currently, I'm doing an internship as a cybersecurity specialist at Roche Diagnostics, where I can apply these concepts and continue learning both software and high-level skills.

## What I Do

With a foundation in Kaizen and Ikigai, I am currently focused on:

* **Cybersecurity Risk Governance and Reporting**: Learning about Business Risk Managament Frameworks (BRMFs) using the latest technologies.
* **Software Engineering Projects**: (coming soon) Developing scalable, maintainable, and efficient software systems and infrastructures applied to stock markets predictions, automating processes, among others.
* **Personal Growth**: Continuously learning, improving, and seeking out new challenges to grow both professionally and personally.
